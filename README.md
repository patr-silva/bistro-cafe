<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

This simulated cafe website, built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, offers online ordering and reservation features. The project serves as a practical exercise to deepen my proficiency in modern web development technologies. Through this project, I am honing my skills in state management, user interface design, and responsive development, all within the React ecosystem. The use of Tailwind CSS ensures a sleek and user-friendly interface, contributing to a seamless user experience.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This project was undertaken as a hands-on exercise to strengthen my proficiency in modern web development, particularly using React and Tailwind CSS. Through the creation of this cafe website, which features online ordering and reservation systems, I have gained practical experience in building a dynamic and responsive web application, from designing an intuitive user interface to implementing client-side logic and interactions.

In the future, I plan to enhance the application by improving the styling of modals for a more polished user experience and integrating various payment methods to streamline the ordering process. These additions will not only refine the aesthetic and functional aspects of the website but also provide users with a more seamless and versatile experience when placing orders or making reservations.

⚠️ This project is in progress and will undergo further refinements to optimize its functionality and user experience.
